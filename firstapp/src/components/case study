Letâ€™s build a very simple React example where we have a student array of objects (with id, name, mark1, mark2) 

Array objects

    { id: 1, name: "Alice", mark1: 85, mark2: 90 },
    { id: 2, name: "Bob", mark1: 70, mark2: 65 },
    { id: 3, name: "Charlie", mark1: 50, mark2: 55 },
    { id: 4, name: "David", mark1: 95, mark2: 92 }

Find the total marks and according to that put the grade

and display them in a table with:

Student ID
Student Name
Mark 1
Mark 2
Total Score
Grade

Add some external css for the design
